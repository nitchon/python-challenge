Module 3 Challenge


Moving from Excel and Visual Basics for Applications, there are two Python challenges in this respository exploring real life scenarios.


## PyBank Instructions
    In the PyBank folder, there are two folders: a resources folder with a financial dataset and an analysis folder with a text document containing the conclusions. There is also a Python script entitled "main.py" The script analyzes the dataset to return the following values:
    * The total number of months
    * The net total amount over the entire period
    * The average change in "Profit/Loss"
    * The greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits, listing the date and amount.

    The script also exports a text document with those results.





## PyPoll Instructions
    Much like the PyBank folder, there are two folders in the PyPoll folder: a resources folder with election data and an analysis folder with a text document containing the conclusions. The PyPoll script analyzes the election data to return the following values:
    * The total number of votes cast
    * A complete list of candidates, their number of votes, and their percentage share of the votes.
    * The winner of the election based on the popular vote.

    The script exports a text document with those results.
